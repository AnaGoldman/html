	My name is Anna Goldman.
    
	Welcome to my first website. This website is my homework from the course HTML online digital by <a href="https://qamasters.co.il/"target = "_blank">QAMasters</a> college,  I started learning the first part of the course -  manual.
    <br/>I’m married, my husband’s name is Basil, he is a software-developer with 18 years of experience. We have two children - our son is getting a second higher education in finance and economics, and our daughter is graduating from school this year. We love animals, our pets are a dog and a cat. They add notes of love in our life, making our lives better full of joy and smiles. We tenderly take care of them and return our love to them. We have our own family values and traditions, supporting and taking care of each other.
    I have always loved reading books and watching old movies, I do sports, and also adore our magical emerald sea, in any weather.
    <br/>I have a pedagogical education, but for the last 15 years I have been working in the field of electronics and electro-optics. Our company develops and manufactures laser devices for the military industry. In my work, I was also busy testing our products, but hardware, not software. Now I would like to join the tech community as a software-tester. What is QA testing and is it good for me? I'm still just trying to understand and take the first uncertain steps. 
    <br/>I created this website not for information , but to practice the knowledge and skills gained from the HTML Course by Gal Matalon. I learned step by step  in the course basic structures, how to create tags, work with texts, how to add photos, including elements and attributes, and how to link between pages.
    I enjoyed working on my first html website.
